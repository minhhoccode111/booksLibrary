# booksLibrary

The Odin Project - JavaScript state books library project

What I've learn :
-import and export functions from another js files

- select parentNode of a button when that button had a click event with:

* button.addEventListener('click',e=>{
  console.log(e.currentTarget.parentNode)
  //show its parent
  })

- we can call onclick like a function to trigger a specific element event
